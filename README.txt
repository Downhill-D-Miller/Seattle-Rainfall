In this project, I do an analysis of Seattle's rainfall from 1948 to 2019. Through constructing a series of histograms and a series of line
charts, I am able to plot some visualizations and point out some general trends in rainfall. To create the visualizations and provide a summary,
I used Python along with the following Python libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
